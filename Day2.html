        When we talk about React Native, itâ€™s an open-source JavaScript-based framework developed by Facebook to meet its growing demand of mobile needs. React Native is a hybrid mobile app framework, allowing you to develop mobile applications with a single codebase. This JavaScript framework lets you build mobile apps that render natively across different platforms like iOS and Android.</li>

    <h2>Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component</h2>

    In React, a stateful component is a component that holds some state. Stateless components, by contrast, have no state. Note that both types of components can use props.
