        <h1>5. High Order Component in react js ?</h1>
        A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature. We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components. const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)

        <h1>What is the use of useCallback and useMemo</h1>
        useMemo - React has a built-in hook called useMemo that allows you to memoize expensive functions so that you can avoid calling them on every render. You simple pass in a function and an array of inputs and useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the inputs has changed.
useCallback - useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

<h1> Why do we need keys in react list and Do you know about redux?</h1>
The main purpose of keys is to help React differentiate and distinguish elements from each other, increasing its performance when diffing between the virtual and real DOM. To use keys, simply add the prop inside an element such as
Unique IDs are the best value to assign to keys. (or) "Key" prop is used to look pretty,

<h1>About Redux</h1>
Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.
